# Architecture — Pokemon Felix

High-level architecture notes and reviews.

Key docs

- AI and system prompts: `ai/architecture.md`, `ai/current_pulse.md`, `ai/system_prompt.md`
- Library & hook reviews: `lib-review.md`, `hooks-review.md`
- Code review summaries: `code_review.md`, `PR_SUMMARY.md`

Suggested reading order

1. `ai/architecture.md` — how AI/agents fit into the app
2. `lib-review.md` — utility libraries and decisions
3. `hooks-review.md` — patterns used for custom hooks

If you want, I can extract diagrams or generate a component dependency graph from `src/` to include here.
