# Project Documentation — Pokemon Felix

The `docs/` folder is organized by purpose to make it easier to find implementation notes, guides, and planning artifacts.

Top-level sections

- Features: documentation and design notes for game features (`docs/features.md`).
- Architecture: high-level architecture, AI notes, and library reviews (`docs/architecture.md`).
- Planning & Roadmaps: implementation plans and roadmap artifacts (`docs/planning.md`).
- Guides: quick-start, development workflow, contributing, and how-tos (`quick-start.md`, `development.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`).

Other content remains in place (battle-system notes, reviews, and historical implementation documents).

To get started, open one of the guides:

- `docs/quick-start.md` — run the app locally
- `docs/development.md` — development workflow and conventions
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — contribution guidelines

If you want, I can move specific files into subfolders; for now this change adds focused index pages linking related docs so the repo structure stays stable while navigation improves.
