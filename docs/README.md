# Project Documentation — Pokemon Felix

The `docs/` folder is organized by purpose to make it easier to find implementation notes, guides, and planning artifacts.

Top-level sections

- Features: documentation and design notes for game features (`docs/features.md`).
- Architecture: high-level architecture, AI notes, and library reviews (`docs/architecture.md`).
- Planning & Roadmaps: implementation plans and roadmap artifacts (`docs/planning.md`).
- Guides: quick-start, development workflow, contributing, and how-tos.

Other content remains in place (battle-system notes, reviews, and historical implementation documents).

To get started, open one of the guides:

- [Quick Start Guide](quick-start.md) — run the app locally
- [Development Workflow](development.md) — development workflow and conventions
- [Integration Guidelines](INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) — asset, UI, and module logic conventions
- [Contribution Guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md) — contribution rules for issues & PRs

Check [PROJECT_STATUS.md](PROJECT_STATUS.md) to see the current state of features implemented.
