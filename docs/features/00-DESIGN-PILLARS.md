# Design Pillars

Pokemon Felix is built upon three interconnected pillars that drive the gameplay loop.

## 1. Care (The Bond)

The foundation of the game is the relationship between the player and their Pokemon.

- **Mechanics**: Feeding, Grooming, Playing.
- **Goal**: Maintain high Affection and good Condition.
- **Impact**: Better cared-for Pokemon perform better in battle (e.g., higher crit rate, dodge chance).

## 2. Training (The Growth)

Training bridges the gap between raw potential and battle readiness.

- **Mechanics**: Educational mini-games (Math, Logic/Porygon Lab).
- **Goal**: Increase specific stats (Attack, Speed, Logic).
- **Design Note**: Games should be age-appropriate (targeting ~7 years old) but scalable.

## 3. Battle (The Test)

Battles are the culmination of Care and Training.

- **Mechanics**: Card-based turn-based combat.
- **Goal**: Defeat opponents to earn Coins and Unlock new areas.
- **Twist**: Unlike traditional Pokemon games, you don't just choose moves; you manage a hand of cards representing your Pokemon's abilities.
