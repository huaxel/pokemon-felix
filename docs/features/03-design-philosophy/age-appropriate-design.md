# Age-Appropriate Design

## Target Audience

- **Primary**: Children aged 6-8.
- **Secondary**: Parents playing with children / Nostalgic adults.

## Principles

### 1. Forgiving Failure

- **No Game Overs**: If a Pokemon faints, it just needs rest. No permanent loss.
- **Try Again**: Mini-games allow infinite retries without punishment.

### 2. Large, Readable UI

- Use **Large Text** (minimum 16px generally, 24px+ for headers).
- **Icon-Heavy**: Use icons (Heart, Lightning Bolt) alongside text to convey meaning for early readers.
- **Clear Feedback**: Big animations for Success/Failure.

### 3. Educational Value

- **Implicit Learning**: Resource management (Money/Coins).
- **Explicit Learning**: Start with simple Logic (Porygon Lab).
