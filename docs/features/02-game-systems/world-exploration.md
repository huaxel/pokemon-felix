# World System

## Overview

A node-based map system where players travel between locations.

## Map Structure

- **Nodes**: Towns, Routes, or Points of Interest (POIs).
- **Edges**: Connections between nodes (Roads).
- **Travel Time**: Moving between nodes might consume in-game time (Morning -> Afternoon).

## Key Locations

1. **Home**: Safe zone. Care/Storage.
2. **Mart**: Shop for items.
3. **Pokemon Center**: Heal fully.
4. **Porygon Lab**: Coding mini-game.
5. **Wild Area**: Random encounters.

## Visuals

The World Map (`WorldPage.jsx`) uses an interactive SVG or Canvas overlay to render the region.
